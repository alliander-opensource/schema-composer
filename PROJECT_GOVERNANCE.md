# Project Governance

The basic principle is that decisions are based on consensus. If this decision making process takes too long or a decision is required, the project committee has the authority to make a decision.

## Technical Steering Committee

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is responsible for:

1. General ambitions, objectives and goals of this project
1. Guidelines and procedures and tool selection
1. Architectural and (development) infrastructure choices
1. Raise subjects/issues that are important for the direction/development of this project

The community council consists of the following members:
1. Product Owner - Team X
1. Product Owner - Team Y
1. Solution Architect - Team X
1. Solution Architect - Team Y
1. Lead Developer - Team X
1. Lead Developer - Team Y

Product Owner - Team X will chair the TSC.

## Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for maintaining parts of the code-base. Maintainers have the following responsibilities

1. Coordinate development activity
1. Make sure code/documentation reviews are being done
1. Coordinate pull-requests
1. Coordinate bug follow-ups
1. Coordinate questions
1. In case of long discussions or arguments, maintainers or other can request a community council decision.

The current maintainers of this project are:
 1. Developer 1 - Team X
 1. Developer 2 - Team X
 1. Developer 3 - Team Y
 1. Developer 4 - Team Y

 ## Contributors

Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the project.

Anyone can become a contributor. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements and no selection process. To become a contributor, a community member simply has to perform one or more actions that are beneficial to the project.
